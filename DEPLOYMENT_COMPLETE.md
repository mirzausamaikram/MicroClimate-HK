## ⭐ Marketing the Project

### LinkedIn Post Draft:
```
🌤️ Excited to share my latest project: MicroClimate HK!

Problem: Traditional weather apps give city-wide forecasts, but Hong Kong's extreme density creates microclimates that vary by 5-8°C within blocks.

Solution: A hyperlocal weather platform with:
✅ 50m x 50m grid precision
✅ Floor-level forecasts (street vs. rooftop)
✅ ML-powered predictions
✅ 10,000+ sensor readings/min
✅ Offline-first PWA

Tech Stack: SvelteKit, FastAPI, Go, TimescaleDB, PostGIS, TensorFlow

```
1/ Just launched MicroClimate HK 🇭🇰 - solving a problem every Hong Konger faces: hyperlocal weather prediction

Your weather app says "sunny" ☀️ but you walk outside and get soaked 🌧️

Thread on how I built this 👇

2/ The Tech Stack:
- Frontend: SvelteKit PWA with deck.gl (3D WebGL maps)
- Backend: Python FastAPI (async APIs)
- Real-time: Go service (10K+ req/min)
- Database: TimescaleDB + PostGIS (3D spatial queries)
- ML: TensorFlow (Urban Canyon CNN)

3/ Key Features:
- Block-by-block weather (50m precision)
- Elevation-aware (ground floor ≠ 30th floor)
- Smart indices (laundry, mould risk)
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Works offline during typhoons

4/ System handles:
- 10,000+ sensor readings/minute
- <100ms API response (cached)
- <50ms WebSocket latency
- 1M+ weather readings in database

All open source! ⭐
